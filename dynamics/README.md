# Dynamics

## About

This directory holds everything related to `dynamics`.
This purpose of Dynamics is to allow for certain parameters
to change periodically on epoch boundaries.
The idea is that eventually these parameters will be controlled
by the governance system.

Prototypical examples include fees for objects and transactions:
these fees determine the overall cost of using AliceNet.
Additional examples include timeouts for Consensus:
these timeouts control how quickly blocks are processed
as well as determine the time between snapshots.
