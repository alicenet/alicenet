Official repository for the AliceNet blockchain.

AliceNet is a Proof-Of-Stake, UTXO based blockchain written in golang that enables high-speed bridging between Layer 1 and Layer 2 protocols while emphasizing strong security and identity standards.

To learn more, check out our official [website](https://https://www.alice.net/) and join our official [Discord community](Discord-7289DA).

## Quick Start

First step to run an AliceNet blockchain node is to get an AliceNet client binary.

Pre-compiled binaries are available in our [release page](https://github.com/alicenet/alicenet/releases). For instructions about how to build and install from the source code, see the [Building instructions](./docs/BUILD.md).

Once you have an AliceNet binary, see the documentation [How to configure and run your node](CONFIGURE.md) to run your own node against one of AliceNet's networks.

## Examples

Basic examples can be found in our official [website](https://https://www.alice.net/).
