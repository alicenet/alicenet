Official repository for the AliceNet blockchain.

AliceNet is a Proof-Of-Stake, UTXO based blockchain written in golang that enables high-speed bridging between Layer 1 and Layer 2 protocols while emphasizing strong security and identity standards.

## Quick Start

The first step to run an AliceNet blockchain node is to get an AliceNet binary.

Pre-compiled binaries are available in our [release page](https://github.com/alicenet/alicenet/releases) and instructions on how to build the binary from the source code, can be found in the [Building from Source](https://github.com/alicenet/alicenet/wiki/Dev%3A-Building) documentation.

Once you have an AliceNet binary, see the documentation [How to configure and run your node](https://github.com/alicenet/alicenet/wiki/Configuring-and-running-your-AliceNet-node) to run your own node against one of AliceNet's networks and check out our official [wallet](https://github.com/alicenet/wallet) to unlock the full potential of your AliceNet node.

## Examples

Basic examples can be found in our official [website](https://www.alice.net/).
