/**
 * @notice This contract locks up publicStaking position for a certain period. The position is
 *  transferred to this contract, and the original owner is entitled to collect profits, and unlock
 *  the position. If the position was kept locked until the end of the locking period, the original
 *  owner will be able to get the original position back, plus any profits gained by the position
 *  (e.g from ALCB sale) + a bonus amount based on the amount of shares of the public staking
 *  position.
 *
 *  Original owner will be able to collect profits from the position normally during the locking
 *  period. However, a certain percentage will be held by the contract and only distributed after the
 *  locking period has finished and the user unlocks.
 *
 *  Original owner will be able to unlock position (partially or fully) before the locking period has
 *  finished. The owner will able to decide which will be the amount unlocked earlier (called
 *  exitAmount). In case of full exit (exitAmount == positionShares), the owner will not get the
 *  percentage of profits of that position that are held by this contract and he will not receive any
 *  bonus amount. In case, of partial exit (exitAmount < positionShares), the owner will be loosing
 *  only the profits + bonus relative to the exiting amount.
