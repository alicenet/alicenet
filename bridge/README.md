# AliceNet/Bridge

This repository contains all solidity smart contracts used by the AliceNet infra-structure.

All the main contracts deployed by AliceNet are available into `./contracts`. Interfaces and support contracts can be found in `./contracts/interfaces`, `./contracts/libraries` and `./contracts/utils`.

## Requirements

All the requisites necessary to run smart contracts are covered on the [Building from source](https://github.com/alicenet/alicenet/wiki/Dev:-Building) documentation.

## Testing

Check the [Testing Documentation](https://github.com/alicenet/alicenet/wiki/Dev:-Testing) for more information on how to run the unit tests for the smart contracts.

## HARDHAT

There is a suite of hardhat scripts and tasks you can run to interact with the deployed contracts. To list them simply run `npx hardhat --help`.
