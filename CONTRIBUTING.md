# Contribution Guidelines

First of all, thanks for taking your time to contribute to the AliceNet development, you are awesome!

## Submitting Issues

Did you discover a bug? Do you have a feature request? Submitting issues is an easy way for you to contribute and help us to improve AliceNet. We use GitHub Issues to track all known bugs and feature requests.

However, before logging an issue be sure to check the current opened and closed issues to see if someone already has submitted the same issue/request.

See the [GitHub help guide](https://docs.github.com/en/issues/tracking-your-work-with-issues/creating-an-issue) for more information on submit a Github issue.

## Vulnerabilities

Please don't create issues for any security vulnerabilities. Instead, we would appreciate it if you reported them through our vulnerability disclosure form. This allows us to distribute a fix before the vulnerability is exploited.

Additionally, if you believe that you've discovered a security vulnerability, you might qualify for our bug bounty program. Visit our [website](https://www.alice.net/) or our [discord server](https://discord.gg/8esBWyr8h3) for details.

## Contributions

Also, read and follow our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) to help us maintain the AliceNet development community a healthy environment.
